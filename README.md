# Drupstrap

**Drupstrap** is a base theme for Drupal, making heavy use of
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). The theme itself uses
[zen](https://drupal.org/project/zen) as a base theme.
All Drupal and Zen CSS files are excluded and manually styled using
Bootstrap's native reset/style stylesheets.

## Features

The theme offers various tweaks and overrides on the theme layer, using
Bootstrap's CSS/components as much as possible to prevent bloat.

Currently included:

* Clean page HTML/page template.
* Sensible default styles for content display. 
* Basic grid (main column, sidebar).
* Forms.
* Breadcrumbs.
* Tables.
* Primary/secondary tabs.
* Status messages.

## TODO

The following features are still `to do':

* (Collapsable) framesets
* Compatibility with system module styles.
* Bootstrap's jQuery plugins.
* Moreâ€¦
